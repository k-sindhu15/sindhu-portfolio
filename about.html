  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr>

  <p>
    I am a final-year Computer Science and Engineering student with strong interest
    in web development and software engineering.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and I enjoy
    building responsive websites.
  </p>

  <p>
    I completed an internship at SBS Technologies as a Bootstrap Intern, where I gained
    real-world development experience.
